# Refuel


Hello! Welcome to the Refuel mobile application. Refuel is an Android app that I developed using Java programming and Firebase as the database and user authentication system.

Let me take you through a quick tour of the app. When you first open the app, you will see the login page. There are separate login pages for users and employees.

To create an account, simply click on the "sign up" button and fill in the required details. Once you've created your account, you can log in and access the user dashboard. From here, you can view your profile, check for nearby fuel stations on Google Maps, and order fuel.

To order fuel, simply click on the "request fuel" button, select the type and quantity of fuel you need, and enter your location. Once you've confirmed your order details, you can submit your order and return to the dashboard.

If you're an employee, you can log in with your email and password to view a list of orders made by customers. You can then deliver the fuel to the specified locations.

Overall, Refuel is a convenient and easy-to-use app that allows users to order fuel from the comfort of their own homes. Thank you for visiting!
